    "## The intent of this Jupyter notebook is to both show how to analyze Fairfax arrests drunk in public data but also to provide building blocks that can be reused for other analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is a Jupyter notebook. It is essentially an environment where you can:\n",
    "1. Run code\n",
    "2. Display the results as text, plots, or other visualizations\n",
    "3. Display text\n",
    "\n",
    "Code and text are organized into cells which can either be:\n",
    "1. Text cells (like this one)\n",
    "2. Code cells (like the next one)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be run individually to run the code in that cell. Running of the cells is cumulative in that if a variable x was created in a cell that was previously run, it can later be used in another cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: Cells are intended to be run in order (but don't have to be). If cells are run out of order, the user must beware of unintended consequences if variables get overwritten. If cell 1 sets x=1, cell 2 sets x = x+3, and cell 3 sets x = 2*x, I would expect x to be (1+3)*2=8 after running cell 3 but if I run cell 1, then cell 2 twice, and then cell 3, x would actually be (1+3+3)*2=14. There are legitimate reasons to run code out of order (i.e. if you need to fix code in a prior cell and don't want/need to start over); you just have to beware that variables are not being reused/overwritten in a way that gives unintended results*\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell, you can:\n",
    "1. Click the play button located next to the cell\n",
    "2. Click CTRL-ENTER on the keyboard\n",
    "3. Click SHIFT-ENTER on the keyboard which will run the code in the cell AND advance to the next cell. Clicking SHIFT-ENTER while a text cell is active will just advance to the next cell\n",
    "Note that the cell that runs is the one that is active (for code cells, the one where the cursor is at). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create new cells, you can:\n",
    "1. Use the menus around the cells to add cells before or after the current one\n",
    "2. If you are running cells, clicking SHIFT-ENTER while the currently *last* cell is active will run that cell and create a new one after it"
