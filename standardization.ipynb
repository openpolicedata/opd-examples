    "## Data Standardization Guide\n",
    "One of the challenges in analyzing police data is that different agencies use different column names for the same type of data and use different codes and terms for the data in those columns. If you are looking at multiple datasets, it is particularly valuable for the data to be standardized so that the user knows in advance what some key columns will be called and what the values in those columns will be. To provide the user with more consistent column names and data, OpenPoliceData (OPD) provides powerful tools to automatically standardize column names and data values. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides details on how the standardization works and how to apply and customize the standardization.\n",

    "## Standardizable Columns\n",
    "Column types and the standardized column names that OpenPoliceData can standardize are shown below. If these column types are identified in the standardization process, they will be standardized."
